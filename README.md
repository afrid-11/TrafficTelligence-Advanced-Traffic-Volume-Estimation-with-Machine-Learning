# TrafficTelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-with-Machine-Learning
"TrafficTelligence—Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning" describes an intelligent system that analyzes various data sources, including historical traffic patterns and weather, to accurately predict vehicle counts and manage urban traffic more effectively
Traffictelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-With-Machine Learning 🚦 Project Overview Trafficeteligence is a smart solution that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to estimate traffic volume accurately in real-time. This project aims to help urban planners and traffic control systems make data-driven decisions to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety.

📌 Key Features 📹 Analyzes traffic video/image data 🧠 Applies ML models to predict traffic volume ⏱ Real-time or batch traffic estimation 📊 Dashboard integration for visualization (optional) 🛣 Supports scalable deployment for smart cities 🧰 Technologies Used Python 🐍 OpenCV for video/image processing Scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow (any ML library used) Pandas, NumPy for data handling Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization Flask for web integration (optional) Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation 📁 Project Structure Trafficeteligence/>.ipynb_checkpoints
